#Diwali Sales Analysis Project

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of sales data during the Diwali season, focusing on consumer behavior, product performance, and marketing effectiveness. The goal was to provide actionable insights to improve sales strategies and decision-making for future holiday seasons. Key aspects of the project include:

Transformed the dataset into a usable format using Python's pandas library (or relevant tools such as Excel/SQL).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed trends in sales across different product categories, customer segments, and time frames.
Identified top-selling products and peak sales periods during the Diwali season.
Created visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Power BI to showcase insights on customer purchasing behavior and regional sales distribution.
Key Insights & Business Recommendations:

Highlighted high-demand products and underperforming categories.
Provided insights on the impact of marketing efforts, discounts, and promotions during the Diwali season.
Suggested pricing strategies and marketing adjustments to improve customer engagement and conversion rates during festive periods.
